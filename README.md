[v0.2 Demo Scenario](https://minty-crisp.github.io/AUXL/)

Learn how to build your first AUXL Scenario with the [Getting Started with AUXL](https://github.com/Minty-Crisp/AUXL/wiki/Getting-Started-with-AUXL) guide using the [Starter Scenario](https://minty-crisp.github.io/AUXL/starter.html).

AUXL Summary : :star2:
---
AUXL is a javascript engine built to streamline and unify the creation of Web XR experiences based on [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/) & [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It provides a variety of critical system, object, scene and scenario building tools that allows the user to create XR experiences as if they were making classic 2D HTML websites or game worlds. The types of website styles that can be built with are as endless as the web itself. Anything like a portfolio, gallery, blog, virtual tour, visual novel, video game and more. I envision the system to be a combination of tools like Wordpress and Unity with a long term plan to create 2D/3D admin panel like generation tools to open access to all users in creating their own personal XR content. It is being released under the GPL 3.0 license for all to use and hopefully will help with the adoption of the Web XR ecosystem.

AUXL is built to accomplish 3 main goals : :hearts:
---
- Dynamic Experiences : Swap through experiences in a single browser session that each have their own set of Scenario defined builds and navigatable Zone maps of Scenes.
- Object Generators : All of the various basic and special objects that you would use, view & interact with inside the 3D environment.
- Universal Controls : The unified hardware input controls for interacting with the 3D content that a browser can communicate with.

If you have made it this far, let me just say Thank You! AUXL has been a dream of mine and a labor of love. I still have so much more to accomplish and it will far easier if I can get others to test, play with, contribute, donate or just offer words of encouragement to keep going. This all wouldn't be possible without the open source work of so many others as well especially the teams that have made A-Frame and Three.js!
