Building Basic AUXL Objects : Teleport
---
Generate interactable confirm and cancel selection of teleportation circles at a provided Vec3 array list.
---
Defining a Teleport Data & Teleport Object :
---
Providing an array of Vec3 positions to spawn at, Teleport will generate a uniquely colored circular clickable floor point at each point. Upon clicking of the object, it will animate upward and face the user for them to confirm click and send the user to that position utilizing the player selected transition (Instant, Blink, Fade, Sphere or Locomotion). The user may also cancel to reset it back to the floor or when the user actually teleports, all opened points will reset.

	let teleportPos0 = [
		new THREE.Vector3(0,0.025,0),
		new THREE.Vector3(-5,0.025,-5),
		new THREE.Vector3(-5,0.025,5),
		new THREE.Vector3(5,0.025,-5),
		new THREE.Vector3(5,0.025,5),
	];
	auxl.teleport0 = auxl.Teleport('teleport0', teleportPos0);

The example above will generate 5 total teleportation points at each of the provided XYZ positions. Animation supports are fixed to the Y position, so only customize X or Z currently.

The Teleport generator takes in 2 parameters, an ID and the Array of points. As usual, the ID must match the Teleport object.

Important note, teleportation only supports moving along X and Z, but not Y positioning at the moment. It will always keep the player at 0 Y for now.

Additional note, there is also a component called raycast-teleportation that does not have any confirm/cancel abilities, but allows the user to click anywhere on the clickable item to teleport with transition to the XZ raycast intersection point of click. So you may utilize any other objects to use for teleportation means like adding to the scene's floor to click teleport anywhere they are pointing at time of selection or individual points like light beams spread out through the scene.

Teleport Methods :
---

SpawnTeleport
---
- Spawns the Teleport into the environment. When spawning via a Scenario, Zone, Scene or Book it is added to that respective instruction tracker.

It does not accept any parameters.

SpawnTeleport()

	teleport0:{SpawnTeleport:null},
- - -

DespawnTeleport
---
- Despawns the Teleport from the environment. When removing via a Scenario, Zone, Scene or Book it is also removed from that respective instruction tracker.

It does not accept any parameters.

DespawnTeleport()

	teleport0:{DespawnTeleport:null},
- - -
